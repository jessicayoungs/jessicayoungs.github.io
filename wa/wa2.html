    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Jessica Youngs (she/her) and I am a Senior Marketing Student with a CTD minor at The University of Colorado, Boulder. I grew up right outside of Columbus, Ohio in a suburb called Dublin, Ohio and I have been living here in Boulder for almost 4 years now. In my free time I love spending time outdoors whether its skiing, running or hiking. My goal for this class is to feel confident enough in my coding skills to share my website with future employers.</p>
